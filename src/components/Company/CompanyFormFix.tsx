// We can't directly modify CompanyForm.tsx as it's read-only,
// but the fix would be to change the import from:
// import { fetchCompanyInfoByName } from "@/services/companyInfoService";
// to:
// import { fetchCompanyInfoByName } from "@/services/companyBridge";

// As an alternative, if possible, change the import to:
// import { fetchCompanyInfo as fetchCompanyInfoByName } from "@/services/companyInfoService";
